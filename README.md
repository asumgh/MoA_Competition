## Description
In this competition, we have access to a unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. The data is based on a new technology that measures simultaneously (within the same samples) human cellsâ€™ responses to drugs in a pool of 100 different cell types (thus solving the problem of identifying ex-ante, which cell types are better suited for a given drug). In addition, you will have access to MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in this dataset.
# Solution
We made a simple neural network with 3 layers and some preprocessing. We trained model on 7 different seeds and every seed trained on 11 folds.
